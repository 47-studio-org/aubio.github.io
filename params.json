  "body": "aubio library\r\n=============\r\n\r\naubio is a library to label music and sounds. It listens to audio signals and\r\nattempts to detect events. For instance, when a drum is hit, at which frequency\r\nis a note, or at what tempo is a rhythmic melody.\r\n\r\nThe homepage of the project can be found at: <https://aubio.org/>.\r\n\r\nThe github page of the project is at: <https://github.com/aubio/aubio/>.\r\n\r\naubio features include segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks,\r\nperforming pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from\r\nlive audio.\r\n\r\naubio provide several algorithms and routines, including:\r\n\r\n  - several onset detection methods\r\n  - different pitch detection methods\r\n  - tempo tracking and beat detection\r\n  - MFCC (mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients)\r\n  - FFT and phase vocoder\r\n  - up/down-sampling\r\n  - digital filters (low pass, high pass, and more)\r\n  - spectral filtering\r\n  - transient/steady-state separation\r\n  - sound file and audio devices read and write access\r\n  - various mathematics utilities for music applications\r\n\r\nThe name aubio comes from _audio_ with a typo: some errors are likely to be\r\nfound in the results.\r\n\r\nPython module\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nA python module to access the library functions is also provided. Please see\r\nthe file `python/README` for more information on how to use it.\r\n\r\nExamples tools\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nA few simple command line tools are included along with the library:\r\n\r\n - `aubioonset` outputs the time stamp of detected note onsets\r\n - `aubiopitch` attempts to identify a fundamental frequency, or pitch, for\r\n   each frame of the input sound\r\n - `aubiomfcc` computes Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficients\r\n - `aubiotrack` outputs the time stamp of detected beats\r\n - `aubionotes` emits midi-like notes, with an onset, a pitch, and a duration\r\n - `aubioquiet` extracts quiet and loud regions\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the python module comes with the following script:\r\n\r\n - `aubiocut` slices sound files at onset or beat timestamps\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe documentation can be found at: <https://aubio.org/documentation>.\r\n\r\nBuild and Installation Instructions\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions can be found at: <https://aubio.org/installation>.\r\n\r\nAuthor and Contact Info\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe home page of this project can be found at: <https://aubio.org/>\r\n\r\nThis software has been written by Paul Brossier and several other contributors.\r\n\r\nCopyright and License Information\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2003-2013 Paul Brossier <piem@aubio.org>\r\n\r\naubio is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the\r\nterms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later\r\nversion.\r\n",
